# Luna-Anticheat

Probably the worst thing I have ever made. This is skidded from other anticheats and other things. So happy I didn't release this as something premium.
This base is terrible, the whole thing is atrocious. I'd recommend not working on this, you'll lose brain cells quickly.

This anticheat was later recoded and released for free as Medusa Anticheat, an open source Spigot 1.7-1.8x anticheat. Check it out below.
